# timestamp-converter

Some simple timestamp utilities.

+ [Unix timestamps](https://lukasschwab.me/timestamp-converter/index.html) (milliseconds and seconds)
+ [ISO 8601 timestamps](https://lukasschwab.me/timestamp-converter/iso.html)
+ [Mongo ID timestamps](https://lukasschwab.me/timestamp-converter/mongo.html)

## Search

`search.html` provides a na√Æve router for [defining a Chrome search engine.](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95426#edit)

To add this search engine to Chrome, visit `chrome://settings/searchEngines`.

1. Click `Add`, and input the following values:
    + **Search Engine:** Timestamp Converter
    + **Keyword:** ts
    + **Query URL:** `https://lukasschwab.me/timestamp-converter/search.html?%s` <br><br>
    ![A screenshot of the search configuration described above.](./img/search-config.png)

2. Click `Add`.

After following these steps, you should be able to type `ts` in the omnibox, hit `Tab`, and then input a timestamp.

### Routing

+ If the search query is empty, you'll be redirected to the Unix timestamp converter by default.
+ If the search query is all digits, you'll be redirected to the Unix timestamp converter.
+ If the search query can be parsed by the Javascript `new Date()` constructor, you'll be redirected to the ISO timestamp converter.
+ Otherwise, you'll be redirected to the Mongo ID converter.

## Notes

There's probably a cleverer way to do this using JS modules, or lazy-loading JS files that have side-effects on the copy.

For now, there's a great degree of duplication between `unix.js`/`mongo.js` and `unix.html`/`mongo.html`.
